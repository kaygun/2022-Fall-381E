    "1. Get the data from the season 2018-2019 as a pandas dataframe. Explain each column in the dataset.\n",
    "2. Write a function that takes the `GAME_ID` as the parameter and returns the full dataset for a given match. Test your function on 5 random matches.\n",
    "3. Write a function that takes the `GAME_ID` as the parameter and returns a dictionary of (key,value) pairs where key is a player name and value is how many times that specific player appears in `PLAYER1_NAME`,`PLAYER2_NAME`, or `PLAYER3_NAME` columns.\n",
    "4. Plot the results of Step 3 as a bar chart sorted from the most active player to the least active player for 5 random games.\n",
    "3. Write a function that takes the `GAME_ID` as the parameter and returns a list of pairs of player names where the pair interacted during the game more than once. Test your function on 5 random matches."

    "3. Filter out those artists that appear fewer than 100 times, and then sort the remaining from the most popular to least popular.\n",
    "4. Plot the result you obtain from Step 3 as a bar chart.\n",
    "5. Repeat Steps 2-4 for the Songs instead of Artists by filtering out the songs that appear 25 times or fewer."

    "4. Write a function that takes two indicators `id1` and `id2` and does a scatter plot of `id1` against `id2` after it drops the years where data is not available for one of the indicators. Your plot must have labels on the x- and the y-axes to indicate which indicators were used. Then draw a scatter plot (10 in total) for every pair of indicators I listed above."
